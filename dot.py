# TRAINING DATA
# data from 8 axes that tell what is around the dot.
#
# A set of training data creates every time when the dot moves.
#
# LABELS
# Right move (the move is right if the dot did not touch the obstacle)
# The rewarding system will be needed to create the labels.
#
# AXE
# the axe will check every pixel from the dot in particular direction
# if it sees just black pixels it puts 0
# if it sees the pixels of an obstacle it puts 1
# if it see the pixesls of the goal it puts 2

# Do I need to put current move in the inputs?
# Nope. The neural network will give me a direction where to move based on its vision!
# I do not need current move there. 
# The neural network will compare the right move with the predicted one.

# I need to store current move and look if the dot was rewarded. If the dot was rewarded ^%$^%$^

# Actually my moves look like this:
# [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# For example 
# when according to axe[0]â†‘ distance to an obstacle is less then 10
# the right move is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Dots that did not touch the obstacle will be added to the training data.
# Dots that reached the goal will be added to the training data a couple of times.

# I AM STUPID

# I do not add the dots that did not reach the goal to the training data.
# I am adding only those dots that reached the goal.

# But I still have the problem that I need a way to reward better those dots that reached the goal.
